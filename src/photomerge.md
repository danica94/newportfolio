   <p class="dpword"> I am trying to tell a story which connects with my roommate Yue and her cat Huggyâ€™s daily life.<br>
In the living room, my roommate is watching TV, watering the flowers and the cat tree shows she has a cat. In the bedroom, she had some fun with her cat. In the corridor,I try to show that she is happy to go back home to see her cat. The space in the room is limited, so I try to build more connection with people and the cat.
