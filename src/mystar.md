   <p class="dpword"> The texture of the wall is very rough, and full of flowers. The path, just like a bridge connects the two girls. We canâ€™t see their faces,but can feel their connection. I adjust the transparency of the cloud. The sun appeared, and the dark clouds faded away. We can see the texture of the mountains and the sky. A girl faces the sun. </p>
