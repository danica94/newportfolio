   <h3 class="projectdetail">Process</h3>
    <p class="dpword">
   I adjusted the layout of the page and placed the order and menu in the navigation bar so that the people who opened the page could see the most important information more clearly.
I put a hero when I designed the web page, hoping to build a closer connection with my customers by focusing on the group.
I compared another milk tea shop around and found that its layout was very confusing, the structure was not complete, and the after-sales service was not very good, so I adjusted these issues in my designs.</p>
