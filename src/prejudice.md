   <p class="dpword">People who are biased against others just like wearing a mask to see people so that they canâ€™t understand people in the right way. People who sufferring from prejudice may feel unfair and feel as if they are walking in a bush of thorns. There is a door locked the justice. This door need a key to open it. Mutual suspicion can not solve the problem. </p>
